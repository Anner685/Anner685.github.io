    <h2>What Are Educational Vouchers?</h2>
    <p>Usually, an educational voucher is a credit of about $2,000 that parents can use towards their child's grade-school education. They can apply it towards private/parochial school tuition or let it go to a public school education.</p>
    <p>Educational vouchers let families choose what type of education is best for them.</p>
